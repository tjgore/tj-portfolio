To start adding styling to our project, we will be using the aesome and easy to use tailwind css framework.

First install tailwind with:

```bash
npm i tailwindcss
```

And create the tailwind config file which allows us to extend tailwind if we need to.

```bash
npm tailwind init
```

This command creates `tailwind.config.js`.
Let's update it with an empty configs.
